plone.opendocument Installation
=======================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install plone.opendocument``. Find out how to install bartools
   (and EasyInstall) here:

 * Create a file called ``plone.opendocument-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="plone.opendocument" />

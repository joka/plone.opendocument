Usage
-----
1) Creating the XSLT:

make allinone -  Creates the XSLT all-in-one.xsl

(Or you may just invoke "make", all-in-one.xsl is it's default target)

2) Using the XSLT:

Most users will want to install the 'odftools' package:

http://opendocumentfellowship.org/development/projects/odftools

For developers, you essentially want to run:

  unzip mydocument.odt
  xsltproc catenate.xsl content.xml > SingleFile.xml
  xsltproc all-in-one.xsl SingleFile.xml > output.html

Parameters
----------
These stylesheets are unable to work out every detail of the transformation,
since they will vary from usage to usage. These parameters are:

	param_baseuri

		The base location of all the contents of the ODF file. Often,
		this will be the directory in which the ODF file was unzipped.
		This is required for image links to be correct,

	param_track_changes

		If given a true value (e.g. 1) the HTML output will show
		deletions recorded through ODF's track-changes feature.
		Insertions are not supported yet. Those will show up as
		regular text with no special formatting.

Pass parameters like this:

  xsltproc --stringparam param_baseuri /home/joebloggs/unpackeddoc
